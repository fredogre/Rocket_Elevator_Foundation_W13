# Rocket_Elevator_Rails_App

The tests are located in the spec folder, I have 4 files of tests: 

address_model_spec.rb

battery_model_spec.rb

quote_controller_spec.rb

leads_controller-spec.rb

I have moved the zendesk functions that are called in the quote and lead controllers. They are located in ./lib/API/zendesk.rb


The dependencies are updated to correct the security issues we had. 

Here's the link for the security report:
